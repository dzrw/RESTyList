# RESTyList Requirements

The API should expose the following capabilities:

- Expose a persistent list of user-editable line items.
- Expose the ability to *complete *or *delete* each line item.
- Ensure that the API contains enough detail for a front-end developer to add filtering on item state.
- The API must be accessible over HTTP and must send and receive JSON.
